Release notes build version 29/03/20

Changes :
* based on Marlin 2.0.5.2
* Identical code base for all SRK1.3 and 1.4 versions
* higher Z-level precission (gone from 12.34 to a 12.345 format)
* resolved bug in Jerk handling, causing erratic movement when jerk values are changed from the default values
* added specific Jerk handling for travel motions
* relaxed thermal strategy to avoid thermal runaway when not using insulated hotends
* added specific fast shortcuts in the custom command system for Preddy XL/Voclano/full metal hotend systems
* added direct Z Height probe reset values for Preddy XL and normal Preddy
* added quick "100cm filament extrusion" menu for Estep calibration
* re-activated Scurve acceleration for smoother movement.

Resolved issues/Bug fixes :
* Fysetc mini print error at the end of SD printing should be resolved
* Crash when Jerk value is modified over LCD menu/Gcode
* The "probing failed" condition should be resolved. If not, you can reset the Z value over the custom command 
system, reset Z to a standard correct base value, and use "Probe Z height" to determine a correct start value for 
your specific Predator.

+ all fixes already implemented in the previous 2.0.5-based build.



Release notes build version 14/03/20

Changes :
* based on Marlin 2.0.5
* Same codebase for all SK1.3 and 1.4 versions
* quick manual "set Z height" presets in custom command section, allowing Predator XL and Predator to share the same firmware version
* several both generic and very condition specific resolved issues. 
* no more risk of effector/top plate crashing when an unexpected filament-out condition would occur at the start of a print
* filament-out sensor hysteresis of 25mm, so no more random filament-out conditions : however this also results in a 25mm delay in terms of when
the filament-out procedure is encountered. Don't worry, it will kick in WAY before the filament becomes an issue.

Resolved issues/Bug fixes :
* manual command filament load/unload corrected (effector would try to raise instead of lower in homed position)
* extruder motor shuts down during filament change routine, allowing manual insertion (Marlin bug)
* correct data return on M48 command
* resolved the G33/Probe issue which was introduced since 2.0.4.X
* "halt bug" when using Fysetc screens (introduced in 2.0.3) should be fixed.
* potential data communication issue when using Octoprint resolved

Known issues :
* currently none. When you bump into an issue, let me know.

Tips :
* while the firmwares allow higher hotend temps (290°C), this is meant for full metal converted hotends. Do NOT exceed 260°C when using the original
hotends, preferably stay below 250°C. When you print above 230°C a lot, seriously consider switching to a full metal hotend design.

Graham Burwise has a great project running using a modified effector allowing an E3DV6 original hotend to be used and provides a service to offer them to
users looking into a soltuion for using full metal E3DV6 hotends : I fully encourage to check out his project !
I provided a somewhat simpler solution by using a MK8 full metal smooth barrel M6x30mm which works well too.  The alternative Zprobe mount is provided in this download too, inclusive the 4020 fan duct for the Volcano version

* when using full metal throats for higher temps, I STRONGLY advise to upgrade the hotend fan with a Sunon 4010 or 4020 fan.  Noctuas are not the best choice
when needing to cool down a full metal hotend.

* DO use the constant 24V line for hotend cooling when switching to full metal hotends.  You can still use the HE1 as temperature controlled fan, I suggest
to use the controllerboard/stepper fan on the HE1 plug so the controller board will only be cooled when the printer is actually working






Release notes build version 090320

Changes :
* changed max Z probe range from +/-20mm to +/-30mm to accomodate full metal hotend conversion with Volcano heater
* changed max hotend temperature to allow higher temps on full metal hotends (use with caution : don't exceed 260° if not using a full metal hotend)
* improved filament-out sensor system, preventing 99,9% of all "false triggers"
* resolved sorting bug in SD card system which could result in the SD card not being readable by the Predator
* optimized bed leveling system : process is greatly accelerated while not reducing accuracy.
* still based on 2.0.3 due to 2.0.4.4 still producing issues for some people. Migration to 2.0.4.4 might be possible after further testing, but I will probably skip 2.0.4.4 completely in terms of release.
* same code base on SKR1.3/1.4 and 1.4Turbo

Known issues : 
* currently none on SKR1.3.   
* M48 not reporting a useable result on SKR1.4Turbo (under investigation)

Next job : 
* adding Network functionality for SKR1.4
* implementing UBL instead of ABL






Release notes build versio 280220

* based on Release version 2.0.3 (new 2.0.4 version up to 2.0.4.4 has serious issues with Delta machines currently)
* Z offset display value corrected
* Probe diameter enlarged to near maximum size (5mm from full radius)
* HE1 (second hotend heater connector) can be connected to hotend fan instead of a constant 24V. Please observe polarity of the HE1 output when 
choosing to do so. By this method, the hotend fan will shut down automatically once the hotend drops below 50°C,
and restart automatically when the hotend temeperature is above 50°.  The same HE1 plug can be used to connect 
a board/stepper cooling fan, letting that fan only operate when the printer is really in use.
Recommendation for using a fixed 24V DC hotend fan still valid but this option leaves the user the choice.
* Games option moved to hidden bottom line of the info screen
* added Custom menu options with preset command structures for doing one-button standard tasks like "extruding 100mm of 
filament" during Estep calibration 
* bed probe strategy refined (discard possible singular bad measurement points)


Known Issues :  
* invoking a filament change when the machine is in a homed position will cause the effector to try and raise itself
while already being on a 0-Z Height : this can cause the tower plate to hit the endstops.

Two solutions exist for this issue :
1) emulate the Chitu firmware method of homing the effector at a park condition so the hotend is always in a safe
position during filament change.  Let me know if you want to test this option and I'll provide a testbuild for that.
2) disable the filament sensor with a M412 S0 command at the beginning the start script in the slicer, and then 
use M412 S1 to reactivate the sensor directly after the effector is positioned to start the purge line

Downside of each solution :
Solution 1 = minute trigger distance changes in the endstops may cause the effector to crash into the model on resume
Solution 2 = conflict when the filament sensor would trigger when the effector is above the "safe zone", (in the "cone" height of the build space)


Release notes build version 031219

* based on the first official release version of Marlin 2. No more beta/bugfix version.
* modified display routine toggles(P)rogress, (E)lapsed, and (R)emaining time
* updated TMC and display libraries

Known Issues :  
* invoking a filament change when the machine is in a homed position will cause the effector to try and raise itself
while already being on a 0-Z Height : this can cause the tower plate to hit the endstops.
Please lower your effector manually prior to invoking a filament change when the effector is in homed position, 
a more suitable solution will be provided in a later build.


Release notes build verison 261119

Modified or Added features : (some were already included in intermediate builds)
* adaptive fan speed (not active during PID)
* improved bed leveling (15X15 matrix with subdivision sampling), resulting in roughly 163 real individual bed measure points and a multitude of interpolated ones
* slower probing and probe approach, multisample probing (3)
* combined Babystep+Z offset in order to make Babysteps part of the eeprom save routine (requested by Peter S.)
* somewhat more relaxed thermal strategy 
* added prebuild firmware.bin files for the 4 most popular hardware configurations
* quick reference wire connection diagram for the SKR1.3

Bugfixes
* Pause/Resume display behavior corrected, no more "stall time" in the display routine
* improved TMC library and general bugfixes
* LCD throttling now works correctly, avoid movement planner buffer runouts.

Known Issues :
* invoking a filament change when the machine is in a homed position will cause the effector to try and raise itself
while already being on a 0-Z Height : this can cause the tower plate to hit the endstops.
Please lower your effector manually prior to invoking a filament change when the effector is in homed position, 
a more suitable solution will be provided in a later build.

Be sure to :
1) look into Marlin. Though the prebuild firmware versions allow most people to start immideatly, having basic knowledge on how stuff works will 
help you in the future, or will allow you to tune in your personal preferences yourself.
2) when you're upgrading an existing firmware, initialise the eeprom space after flashing and restore firmware defaults prior to doing anything else
3) start with a Delta Auto Calibration prior to bed leveling. Acceptable deviations should not exceed 0.050. Redo the routine if the first endresult is worse than this.
4) preheat your bed prior to executing a bed level routine. 

Special thanks goes out to Peter S. for his test work, and Christopher Hern for helping me find the ghosts in the
attic on this build.
